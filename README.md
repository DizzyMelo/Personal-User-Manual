# Daniel Melo

## My Style
* I am a nice guy who likes to live life slowly. I like to live with what is essential to me and worry only about things that are significant to me somehow.

## My Values
* Family is what has most value to me. My wife is my greatest partner in life. My family comes first, even before myself. 

## When to approach me
* Definitely the best time to approach me is in the morning when I am not concentrated studying or working. The worst time to approach me is when I am frustrated or trying to solve an important problem, I just have some sort of hyper focus and can't think of nothing else.
